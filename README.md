I'm basically super in love Angus Croll's book `If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript`. So I'm like stealing that for this repo name. But it applies well because this code is my first foray writing a bunch of node and nosql (mongo) in my own flavor. The goal is to rely as little on frameworks as possible and write as much boilerplate as possible*. This is will be a sort of kitchen sink for things that come to my mind to put on the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). I kinda hope it becomes a bit sprawling in terms of function, but still well-organized and articulated. 

Right now I've got a Goodreads clone in the works to track all my "reads." Aside from having at least one interesting code sample for job hunting (everything I’ve ever built in company private repos) and leveling up my skills, was more control over tracking and storing the shared human knowledge passing between my ears;  and then  extracting my own notes and reflections from the (literal) margins into a query-able data store of my own design. That’s the real meat—a memory store for my thought dispersion, all my notes federated. So I don’t have to flip through all these paper stacks and decipher years-old scribbles.
