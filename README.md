I'm basically super in love Angus Croll's book `If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript` so I'm like stealing that for this repo name. But it applies well because this code is my first foray building a green field universal JS web application with Node and Mongo; sort of a kitchen sink for things that come to my mind to put on the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). And because my goal trying to rely as little on frameworks as possible, the code output tends to have the personal flavor of yours truly.
